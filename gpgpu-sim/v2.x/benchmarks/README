To run benchmarks on GPGPU-Sim, you first need to place a copy or link to the
configuration files (gpgpusim.config and the interconnect configuration file)
in the simulation run directory.  You can do this using the script
"setup_config.sh" in this directory, which creates symbolic links. For example:

	./setup_config.sh QuadroFX5800

To change the configuration, you need to first run

	./setup_config.sh --cleanup

The configuration string to use is a directory name in $GPGPUSIM_ROOT/configs

NOTE ** As of GPGPU-Sim 2.1.0b, GPGPU-Sim works with applications without
recompiling by using the PTX source embedded during the normal CUDA compilation
flow.

Preface your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable with the locaton
$GPGPUSIM_ROOT/lib
